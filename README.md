# BasicCPIDeflationRBI

Simple python script based on manually prepared data from CPI values published by RBI [here](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/AnnualPublications.aspx?head=Handbook%20of%20Statistics%20on%20Indian%20Economy)

The script can inflate or deflate values from one year to another. It can also use linkage factors if RBI has specified it, to calculate values between years with different base years.


## Requirements

Python with pandas installed.

Install python,
open terminal, type 
`pip install pandas`

## Usage

Place `BasicCPIDeflationRBI.py` and `rbi_consumer_price_index.csv` in the same directory.
Then just run the script in a terminal or command prompt. 

## Example
